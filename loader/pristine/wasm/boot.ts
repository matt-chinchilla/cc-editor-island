/**
 * Boot a KiCad tool directly in the main React document — no iframe.
 *
 * This is a faithful port of the proven harness HTML (tests/apps/kicad/<tool>.html):
 * it builds the same global `Module` config, runs the same preRun steps (create
 * canvas, write images.tar.gz, seed config), then injects `wx.js`, `wx-dom.js`,
 * and `<tool>.js`. The KiCad WASM build is NON-modularized, so it reads a global
 * `var Module` and publishes `FS`/`wxElementRegistry` onto `window` — exactly the
 * surface the iframe approach used, only now in the top-level window.
 *
 * Running in the main document (rather than at /wasm/...) works without touching
 * the build because `locateFile` is overridden to resolve `<base>/<file>`, so
 * the .wasm and other assets are fetched from the asset dir regardless of the
 * SPA route the user is on. Pthread child workers spawn from `_scriptName`
 * (the glue's own absolute URL, captured when `<tool>.js` executes), so a
 * same-origin asset base just works. KNOWN GAP: a cross-origin (CDN) base
 * cannot spawn the pthread workers — `new Worker(<cross-origin URL>)` is a
 * SecurityError, and emscripten 6 ignores `mainScriptUrlOrBlob` — see
 * docs/features/async/23-jspi-runtime.md.
 *
 * Single-instance: the build owns process-global state (one `Module`, one wasm
 * memory) so only ONE tool can run per page load. A second boot — switching
 * tools, or a stray double-mount — is rejected; switching tools requires a full
 * page navigation (which gives a fresh global scope, same as loading a new HTML).
